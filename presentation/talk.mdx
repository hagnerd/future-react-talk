# The Future is Nearly Here

<Notes>
  <li>
    With the upcoming releases in react (16.7, up to 17) there are some big
    changes coming
  </li>
  <li>
    I think they'll allow you to do even more complicated things, even easier
    than you can do them now.
  </li>
  <li>
    But they'll require you to think differently than you have thought about
    code in React up until now
  </li>

# Hooks

## The Divide

Reactions Fell into Two Categories:

<Appear>
  <li>Disgust</li>
  <li>Hype</li>
</Appear>

<Notes>
  <li>This year at React Conf the React team dropped a bomb by announcing Hooks, a new API in react that gives Funciton Components immense power, I noticed two extreme reactions:</li>
  <li>Disgust with the proposed feature</li>
  <li>And extreme hype</li>
  <li>I'll be honest and say that I was instantly hyped. Hooks solve some pain points that I've had with HOCs and Render Props. Don't get me wrong I still love both, but Hooks let you have the best of both worlds without the excessive boilerplate of using classes in JavaScript</li>

  <li>However, I think that the best way to form an opinion for yourself is to get your hands dirty and try it out</li>
